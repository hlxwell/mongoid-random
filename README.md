mongoid-random
==============

Randomization extension for Mongoid

This Gem will help you to get random record from a collection in database.

The requirement is from www.memoryforcer.com, there is one guy asked me to give a random word list instead of giving words always from A to Z.

So now I can do `List.first.words.random(10)` then it will give `[Good, Bra, For, Apple]`
